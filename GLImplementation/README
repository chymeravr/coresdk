=================================
GLImplementation Module contains an implementation of CoreEngine objects
for Opengl, OpenGLES2 and OpenGLES3 APIs.
OpenGL and OpenGLES are mostly similar. However, there are significant 
difference exists in Shader languages (GLSL). We have tried our best to 
use same implementation across the 3 APIs. 
There are very subtle differences between OpenGLES2 and OpenGLES3. The
function calls are identical. However, the accepted parameters of 
identical functions are not identical. Read the API documentation carefully
and compare. Prior experience suggests this could resolve prickly bugs. 


The choice of GL vs GLES is resolved by CMakeList which is passed a parameter
by the build system (CMake for Windows and Gradle for Android). Only the relavent
files are included during build. 

Major Classes that have different implementations for GL, GLES2 & GLES3 are
    - Scene
    - TextureText

Additionally, Shader Headers are different.
