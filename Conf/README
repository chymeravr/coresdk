--------------------
Rendering libraries like to define their own data types for optimization purposes.
This makes writing cross platform libraries harder. We solve this by creating
an abstraction over most data types. The compiler binds our abstraction to the 
relavent data types of these rendering libraries at compile time. For example
in OpenGL, floats are represented as GLfloat. We map our own type to this by 
aliasing (typedef) GLfloat to CL_GLfloat. GLfloat type definition changes b/w
OpenGL and OpenGLES. Our aliasing prevents us from writing repeated code. 

It currently contains aliasing definitions for the following 
    - OpenGL
    - OpenGLES2
    - OpenGLES3
    - NonGL
