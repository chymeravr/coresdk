Image360 module implements a 360 Image viewer using the CoreEngine Module. 
Image360 Supports the following image formats
    - Equirectangular Map
    - Cube Map

Equirectangular format is more popular though John Cormak (Oculus Big Daddy)
recommends Cube Map format. 

Image360 also supports two viewing modes
    - Stereo
    - Mono

Stereo Images give depth perception and are preferable for VR Environments
